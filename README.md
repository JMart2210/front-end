## Admin Dashboard
Created an admin dashboard, using Grid to layout the site. To facilitate the expanding project cards, I used a grid-template-column property, utilizing repeat, auto-fit, and min-max with a defined size as well as fractional units. This maintained a consistent visual appearance while also letting the projects expand and contract with the screen width.
